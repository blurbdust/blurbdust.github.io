I think decided how I want to do this. I will make it one giant page where I add in new stuff at the top.

## Merry Christmas everyone. 
Yes in ~~July~~ August. I made yet another blog. This time I fully intend to keep it going or at least edited more than once a year. Why do you have [blurbdust.com](http://blurbdust.com) you ask? Well that's more of a professional blog, like an online resume that also contains my resume. 

## Who are you? What are you doing in my house?
I'm a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. If you're not one of the few people that stay up to date on all things me, (shoutout to those who do, you're great), then you won't know I **really** enjoy breaking things. I purposfully take things apart basically as soon as I get them because it adds a bit of excitment to getting new things. By breaking things I generally learn how they work but not all the time. Since I'm writing this in markdown I can get fancy while still being lazy! So how about a bulleted list of things I like/like to do?

* Python and C programming
* All things AI (Artificial Intelligence)
* SDR (Software Defined Radio)
* Linux Sysadmin and security
* CTFs (Capture the Flag (on a computer not outside))
* [Random challenges on the internet](https://twitter.com/argonne/status/840383280079855616)

Once I figure out how I want to structure this page I'll update this again. See you within 6 hours?

## Merry Christmas everyone. 
Yes in ~~July~~ August. I made yet another blog. This time I fully intend to keep it going or at least edited more than once a year. Why do you have [blurbdust.com](http://blurbdust.com) you ask? Well that's more of a professional blog, like an online resume that also contains my resume. 

## Who are you? What are you doing in my house?
I'm a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. If you're not one of the few people that stay up to date on all things me, (shoutout to those who do, you're great), then you won't know I **really** enjoy breaking things. I purposfully take things apart basically as soon as I get them because it adds a bit of excitment to getting new things. By breaking things I generally learn how they work but not all the time. Since I'm writing this in markdown I can get fancy while still being lazy! So how about a bulleted list of things I like/like to do?

* Python and C programming
* All things AI (Artificial Intelligence)
* SDR (Software Defined Radio)
* Linux Sysadmin and security
* CTFs (Capture the Flag (on a computer not outside))
* [Random challenges on the internet](https://twitter.com/argonne/status/840383280079855616)

~~Once I figure out how I want to structure this page I'll update this again. See you within 6 hours?~~
I think decided how I want to do this. I will make it one giant page where I add in new stuff at the top. With a table of index by date? Nah, we'll do it by day. Linearally within the day with the most recent day at the top. Cool? Cool.

## Do I know you? Have you made something I've used?
Probably not, at least not yet. I got two [PlutoSDRs](http://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html) and will be doing a lot of hacking things together to get it working with other things. The standard block provded by Analog Devices for use in GNURadio was broken so I ~~fixed~~ worked aorund that. See [gr-iio](https://github.com/blurbdust/gr-iio) here. Some of the README from that repo will be copied here so sory, not sorry. Fun fact, this is the fourth time eating Chinese food within 24 hours. Ocassionally I live off fried rice. As far as I'm aware, I got my PkutoSDR very early and not many people have them or have gotten them working yet. Gr-iio lets you use the radio within GNURadio. For those of you who don't know, GNURadio is an open source framework that aloows you to connect blocks together to model radios and use them immediatly. This is great because it lets you model things and test it instantly, no soldering required. Another thing you can do it see the pretty waterfall of the radio specturm. Don't belive me?

Yes that is Kali Linux. Yes I do need a hacking distro occasionally. I participate in the [Cyber Defense Competition](https://cdc.iseage.org/) at ISU plus basically every major online CTF. No I'm not very good at CTFs but I'm learning and having fun and that's the part that counts, right? I am pretty decent at the CDC though. I like knowing who or what is using a system that I am also using so I've been locking things down for a few years now and somethings are scripted while others aren't because installing things at 3:00am is oh so fun! Sometimes I do it correctly and TSB gets first in the [National Cyber Defense Competition](https://cdc.iseage.org/769-2/).
